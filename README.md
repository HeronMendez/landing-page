Landing Page Project

As part of the Foundations Course in "The Odin Project" (URL: https://www.theodinproject.com/), the goal of this project is to practice Flexbox. This is the final lesson on the subject. Using the provided design mockup, and without any guidance, the task is to build a simple landing page using Flexbox to match the design.

As a complete beginner in the web development environment, I found this project challenging but very rewarding. By the end, I had successfully made the page look like the provided design. I learned a lot about positioning elements on the page and am very excited to continue my journey into web development.
